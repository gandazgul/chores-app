# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

- This project is a "Chore App" or chore management application focused on household Chores with constant reminders for chores until marked as done in the app

## Problems It Solves

- Helps users organize, assign and track household chores.
- The reminders keep happening constantly until the chore is marked as done or skipped.

## How It Should Work

- Users must sign in with their Google account to use the app.
- Users can view a list of their chores.
- Users can add new chores with titles, descriptions, priorities, due dates, and recurrence rules.
- Users can mark chores as complete.
- Users can delete chores.
- Chores may have descriptions.
- Chores may have due dates and potentially recurring schedules.
- Due dates can be long periods like a week or month. e.g. every June you need to plan the Kids birthday party. Or the first week of each month you have to check the budget.
- Chores are sorted (likely by due date or completion status).
- The app will send push notifications to remind users of their chores.

## User Experience Goals

The app needs to be user friendly, with a strong focus on mobile usability. The focus should be on the chores that are due today (or this week, month depending on the schedule)
