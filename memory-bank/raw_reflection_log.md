TaskRef: "Refactor currentUser prop drilling to Solid.js Context in Chores App"

Learnings:
- Successfully implemented Solid.js Context:
  - Defined `UserContext = createContext()`.
  - Created `UserProvider(props)` component that takes `currentUser` signal as a prop and provides it: `<UserContext.Provider value={props.currentUser}>`.
  - Created `useUser()` custom hook: `const context = useContext(UserContext); return context;`.
- `useUser()` returns the signal; invoke with `()` to get its value (e.g., `const user = currentUser();`).
- Auto-formatters might add related imports (e.g., `useContext` alongside a custom hook like `useUser`). This needs to be considered for `SEARCH` blocks in `replace_in_file`.
- Using optional chaining (e.g., `currentUser()?.user_metadata`) is good practice when dealing with potentially null objects from context.

Difficulties:
- `plan_mode_respond` tool: Forgot to wrap the response content within `<response>` tags, leading to a tool execution error. Corrected by adding the tags.

Successes:
- The refactoring plan to use Context was successfully implemented across `UserContext.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `Layout.jsx`, and `Chores.jsx`.
- Using `read_file` for "recently modified" files before `replace_in_file` ensured `SEARCH` blocks were accurate and prevented potential errors.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Solid.js Context setup (`createContext`, Provider component, `useContext` or custom hook).
- Reminder: Always verify tool parameter requirements, especially for tools like `plan_mode_respond` that have specific content structures.
- Best Practice: Re-read files marked as "recently modified" before attempting `replace_in_file`.
