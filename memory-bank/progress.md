# Progress

## What Works

- User authentication via Google Sign-In.
- Push notification setup for chore reminders.
- Displaying a list of chores (`Chores.jsx`, `Chore.jsx`).
- Adding new chores (via `AddChoreModal.jsx` and `Chores.jsx` handlers).
- Marking chores as done.
- Deleting chores.
- Displaying chore descriptions.
- Data persistence using a local SQLite database.
- Recurring chores functionality.
- Fuzzy search for chores.

## What's Left to Build

- Detailed UI/UX for all features.
- Advanced features for recurring chores if not fully implemented.
- Error handling and validation.
- Styling refinements beyond PicoCSS defaults.
- Testing (unit, integration, e2e).
- Deployment setup.

## Current Status

- Core components for chore management are in place.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for chores are implemented.
- User authentication and push notifications are functional.
- The application is a SolidJS project built with Vite, using Knex.js for database management and Firebase for backend services.
