# Project Brief

The goal of this project is to build a robust but simple Chore App focused on household chores with the key differentiating feature of contant reminders about chores until they are marked as done in the app.

## Core Requirements and Goals

- This project is a web application built using SolidJS, Vite, PicoCSS, Less.
- I would like to integrate push notifications and make the app installable on a mobile device as a PWA. 

TODO:
* Due dates can be fuzzy like an entire month or week (specific, week 30 or first week in June).
* Due dates can be set to repeat every quarter. 
* Ability to set repeat fuzzy dates like twice a week without specifying which days, e.g. 4 times a day walk the dogs, twice a week work out.
* Add a way to set a priority for chores
* Auth
* Storage
* Deployment
* Instalable PWA
* Implement notifications for chores
* Add a way to assign chores to people
* view my chores due today is the default view, but you can view all your chores and ALL chores as well. Maybe the other users are a side bar or someother easy filter.
