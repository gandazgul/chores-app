# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Initializing the Memory Bank with current project information.
- Finish MVP as defined by the current TODO list
- Deploy it
- Add unit tests

## Recent Changes

- Created the core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Populated `techContext.md` with information from `package.json` (technologies, development setup, dependencies).

## Next Steps

- Continue populating Memory Bank files with information from the existing project.
- Review `README.md` for project overview.
- Analyze existing source code (`src/` directory) to understand project structure and functionality.
