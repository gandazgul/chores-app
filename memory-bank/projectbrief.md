# Project Brief

The goal of this project is to build a robust but simple Todo App focused on household chores with the key differentiating feature of contant reminders about chores until they are marked as done in the app.

## Core Requirements and Goals

- This project is a web application built using SolidJS and Vite.
- I would like to integrate push notifications and make the app installable on a mobile device as a PWA. 

TODO:
* Add a way to set a due date for chores, due dates can be fuzzy like an entire month or a specific day and time.
* Due dates can be set to repeat every day, week, month, or year. Also want to be able to set repeat fuzzy dates like twice a week without specifying which days.
* Add a way to set a priority for chores
* Add a way to assign chores to people
* Implement notifications for chores
* view my chores is the default view, but you can view all chores
