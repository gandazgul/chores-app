# Push Notification Implementation Plan

To implement push notifications for task due dates, we'll need to address both the client-side (your web application and service worker) and a server-side component.

Here's the proposed plan:

### Phase 1: Client-Side Implementation

1.  **Request Notification Permission:** I will add code to `src/App.jsx` (or `src/index.jsx`, depending on where it fits best with existing logic) to:
    *   Check if the browser supports push notifications.
    *   Prompt the user for notification permission.
    *   If permission is granted, subscribe the user to push notifications.
2.  **Obtain Push Subscription:** Once subscribed, the browser will provide a `PushSubscription` object. This object contains the endpoint and keys necessary for a server to send notifications to this specific user.
3.  **Send Subscription to Server:** The `PushSubscription` object needs to be sent to your backend server. I will add a placeholder function for this, as I cannot directly implement the server-side API endpoint.
4.  **VAPID Public Key:** The client-side needs your VAPID public key to subscribe. We'll need to decide how to provide this to the client.

### Phase 2: Server-Side Implementation (Guidance)

Since I cannot directly create or modify server-side code in this environment, you will need to implement the following on your backend:

1.  **Generate VAPID Keys:** You'll need to generate a pair of VAPID keys (public and private). These are used to authenticate your server with the push service.
    *   *Example (Node.js with `web-push`):* `webpush.generateVAPIDKeys()`
2.  **Store Push Subscriptions:** Create an API endpoint to receive the `PushSubscription` objects from the client. Store these securely in your database, associated with the user.
3.  **Send Push Notifications:** When a chore is due, your server logic will:
    *   Retrieve the relevant `PushSubscription` from your database.
    *   Use a push notification library (e.g., `web-push` for Node.js, `pywebpush` for Python) and your VAPID private key to send a notification payload to the subscription endpoint.
    *   The payload can contain information like the chore name, due date, etc.

### Phase 3: Service Worker Enhancement (Minor)

1.  **Customize Notification Display:** The existing `src/sw.js` already has a `push` event listener. I can enhance it to parse the incoming notification data and display a more informative notification (e.g., showing the chore name and due time).
