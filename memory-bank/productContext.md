- The reminders keep happening constantly until the chore is marked as done or skipped.

- Users can view a list of all chores.
- Users can add new chores.
- Users can mark chores as complete.
- Users can delete chores.
- Chores may have descriptions.
- Chores may have due dates and potentially recurring schedules.
- Due dates can be long periods like a week or month. e.g. every June you need to plan the Kids birthday party. Or the first week of each month you have to check the budget.
- Chores are sorted (likely by due date or completion status).
- Chores are assigned to specific users or unassigned
- Users can assign a chore to themselves or another user, the other user gets notified

## User Experience Goals

The app needs to be user friendly, with a strong focus on mobile usability. The focus should be on the chores that are due today (or this week, month depending on the schedule)
