## Why This Project Exists

- This project is a "Todo App" or task management application focused on household Chores with constant reminders for chores until marked as done in the app

## Problems It Solves

- The reminders keep happening constantly until the chore is marked as done or skipped.

## How It Should Work

- Users can view a list of their tasks.
- Users can view a list of all tasks.
- Users can add new tasks.
- Users can mark tasks as complete.
- Users can delete tasks.
- Tasks may have descriptions.
- Tasks may have due dates and potentially recurring schedules.
- Due dates can be long periods like a week or month. e.g. every June you need to plan the Kids birthday party. Or the first week of each month you have to check the budget.
- Tasks are sorted (likely by due date or completion status).
- Tasks are assigned to specific users or unassigned
- Users can assign a task to themselves or another user, the other user gets notified

## User Experience Goals

The app needs to be user friendly, with a strong focus on mobile usability. The focus should be on the tasks that are due today (or this week, month depending on the schedule)
